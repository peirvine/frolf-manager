  bio: 'Howdy! I\'ve been a part of this league since its inception in 2022 and have enjoyed getting involved ever since. With my baseball background, I have co-authored the “Hammer” movement with Greg to take advantage of my cannon of a right arm. While this strategy may lead to extensive medical procedures in the future, I will do whatever it takes to win. As the only person of color in this league, I\'m honored to not only be the flag bearer for diversity and inclusion in this (largely) white sport but to also be this league\'s Chief Diversity Officer. Ask any of our league members and they will wholeheartedly agree that I have managed to make this sport inclusive and made them acknowledge that racism is still a problem in the game today. During my time with this league, I have had many fun experiences including finishing 2nd in the inaugural Tournament of Champions, observing Jimmy getting rimmed (by the net), and watching Peter implode occasionally. I will continue to be the most truant member as I move to Chicago for my MBA this year, so I can\'t wait to not show up to most league events and manage to get 2nd in the Tournament of Champions',
